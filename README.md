I'm an international student from India and recently moved to SF. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Physics and a gradute degree in Business
Intelligence and Analytics. I have decided to jump ship from Physics to Data Analytics during my gap year after college. I was intering at 
a bauxite firm and have quickly realized the importance of data analysis in making effective decisions. I decided to go back to college to learn 
more about data analytics and business. I have successfully gradutead in Decemeber 2020 and moved to the Bay Area in January 2021 to find 
a Data Analyst role in the tech landscape. 

Fun Fact: I have learnt Japanese for 2 years. 

I am working on a [portfolio](https://rana.putta/) listing some of my experiences, hobbies, pet-projects, and other things.
