I'm an international student from India (Hyderabad) and moved to the Bay Area in 2021. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Physics and a graduate degree in Business
Intelligence and Analytics (BIA). I have decided to jump ship from Physics to Data Analytics during my gap year after college. While intering at 
a bauxite mining firm in India, I quickly realized the importance of data analysis in decision making and how crutial data is in the limited feedback loop that exsisted in the mining business. It was then when I decided to learn more about data analytics in business. I went back to college to learn more on this subject matter and I have successfully graduated with BIA master's degree in December 2020. I am actively looking for Data Analyst Intern/Part-time roles in the Bay Area.


I am working on a [portfolio](https://rana.putta/) listing some of my experiences, hobbies, pet-projects, and interests.
